OLD LIST OF BUGS (SHOULD CHECK ANYWAY):

1. Pawnshop:
    - if player isn't able to carry everything that the pawnshop is trying to givem it will give what the player can carry,
      but won't set the items as picked up and will keep giving the item that the player can carry, allowing duplication of items

2. Inventory:
    - If player is in a vehicles trunk and gets hit/falls over the trunk will allow players to take items out but won't register the items as being taken out
      allowing duplication of items

4. add lab keys to blackmarket

5. hud shows nos in car even if car doesn't have nos

6. financing a vehicle won't autopay for it, get's repod if no payments are made

-- Whole Server:
    - things start to respond slow? causes problems in every script

-- Misc:
    - when police impound cars it is indefinite (dv'd cars go to impound but phone wont show that)
