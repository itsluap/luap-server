if i do this again i need to make sure that i have a fully working server with no bugs unless it's something that i can't control, this includes everything from wesbite(forums,store,etc), the actual server, discord server(staff,ticket system, etc)


-- monetization
    - finish patreon (patreon only goes towards supporting server - no benefits)
    - finish tebex (tebex is where people can make payments with benefits)

-- bugs
    - work out all bugs before adding new 'big' scripts

-- go through heist system
    - add more heists
    - seperate hacks for new heists
    - go through house roberries

-- go through drug system
    - make improvements as neccessary
    - test corner selling, possibly use another system for players who don't want to corner sell
    -

-- police
    - make sure ps dispatch codes are correct
    - most bank robberies are showing as 10-99
    - SOP needs to be finished
    - State Statutes needs to be finished (wait for someome who wants to run DOJ?)

-- cars
    - finish car dealers asap -- PRICES ARENT SET
    - finish car drop asap (handling, headlights/taillights, oversize)
    - make sure player owned cars can't be lockpicked - need to hack with an electronickit
    - find out whats locking vehicle wheels: pretty sure its seatbelt script, SetVehicleEngine, SetVehicleUnusable

    - start to balance out materials for crafting 
    - slowly move into a crafting system only for mechs and most things
