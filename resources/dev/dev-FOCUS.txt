TODO 12/21/22:
    1. figure out headlights (or atleast find an id that works / or make your own headlight id that works) (applies for taillights too)
    2. go through clothing pack this is in server and remove bad files (glitching clothes)
    3. get second clothing pack finished and put into server (test to see if its working)
    4. fix website, make it mobile friendly, only has to direct to forums and discord 
    5. work on rules, take notes on keybinds and commands (build job guides)
    6. check economy IN-GAME, make sure prices make sense and arent to cheap (too expensive is okay)

WORKKKKKK:
-- finish clothing
-- finish heists / crime
-- weight system
-- test as much in server as possible


|| VEHICLES ||
-- choose which cars to put in server for launch (make sure to clean out cars not being used) (keep every car in dev server)
-- no broken headlights or taillights allowed (can launch with some broken headlights) (can be worked on in dev server after launch)
-- no oversized vehicles (fix textures for every car)
-- mechanic shops and car dealerships 100% good to go (no bugs / everything working / prices)
====
-- find a car that has no coronas and use the id for other cars (id 999 works for this) (use 1249 instead)
-- some headlights are uneven (not crazy important)
-- find a car that has perfect headlights (need 2 / one for white lights / one for yellow lights) and make it its own resource and start it before normal car pack
-- ^^ then make all cars follow the respective light id (white or yellow) ^^
====

|| CLOTHING ||
-- no broken clothing
-- only way to do clothing: rebuild in dutycloth (need to go through every single ydd in 'clothingpack' to check for textures, heels, hats)
-- ^^ make sure to check for skin data ^^
-- ^^ check for bugs / crashes ^^ remove broken / duplicate files ^^
-- ^^ delete un-needed police clothing if possible ^^
-- ^^ double check okayed files for heels and skin data ^^
