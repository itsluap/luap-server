What we need done:
    - Job Guides / Intructions (Example: How to be a police officer, ems member, etc)
    - Weight for items needs to be balanced and make sense
    - List of default keybinds and commands (Most can be changed in, Settings > Keybinds > FiveM)
    - check economy IN-GAME, make sure prices make sense and arent to cheap (too expensive is okay)
    - go through clothing pack this is in server and remove bad files (glitching clothes)
    - get second clothing pack finished and put into server (test to see if its working)

WORKKKKKK:
-- finish clothing
-- weight system

|| VEHICLES ||

====

To Do:

After launch:

====
-- find a car that has perfect headlights (need 2 / one for white lights / one for yellow lights) and make it its own resource and start it before normal car pack (id 999 works for this) (use 1249 instead) (car: m2f22 light id: 756 color: white)
-- ^^ then make all cars follow the respective light id (white or yellow) ^^
-- some headlights are uneven (not crazy important)
