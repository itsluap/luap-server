What we need done:
    - Job Guides / Intructions (Example: How to be a police officer, ems member, etc)
    - Weight for items needs to be balanced and make sense
    - List of default keybinds (Most can be changed in, Settings > Keybinds > FiveM)
    - Check shop prices (Check ALL prices / Double check economy)
    - Finish and post rules
    - Finish website and forums
    - Finish clothing and car headlights/taillights




TODO 12/21/22:
    1. figure out headlights (or atleast find an id that works / or make your own headlight id that works) (applies for taillights too)
    2. go through clothing pack this is in server and remove bad files (glitching clothes)
    3. get second clothing pack finished and put into server (test to see if its working)
    4. fix website, make it mobile friendly, only has to direct to forums and discord 
    5. work on rules, take notes on keybinds and commands (build job guides)
    6. check economy IN-GAME, make sure prices make sense and arent to cheap (too expensive is okay)
    

WORKKKKKK:
-- finish clothing
-- finish heists / crime
-- weight system
-- test as much in server as possible


|| VEHICLES ||
-- no broken headlights or taillights allowed (can launch with some broken headlights) (can be worked on in dev server after launch)
-- no oversized vehicles (fix textures for every car)
-- mechanic shops and car dealerships 100% good to go (no bugs / everything working / prices)
====
-- find a car that has perfect headlights (need 2 / one for white lights / one for yellow lights) and make it its own resource and start it before normal car pack (id 999 works for this) (use 1249 instead)
-- ^^ then make all cars follow the respective light id (white or yellow) ^^
-- some headlights are uneven (not crazy important)
====

|| CLOTHING ||
-- no broken clothing (check for textures, heels, hats, and skin data)
