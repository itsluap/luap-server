|| VEHICLES ||

-- choose which cars to put in server for launch (keep every car in dev server)
-- make sure handling is balanced and good for racing and pd chases (can be worked on in dev server)
-- no broken headlights or taillights allowed (can be worked on in dev server)
-- no oversized vehicles (fix textures)
-- mechanic shops and car dealerships 100% good to go
-- Boosting: wait for better boosting script OR try to keep building my own

-- find a car that has no coronas and use the id for other cars (id 999 works for this) (use 1249 instead)
-- some headlights are uneven (not crazy important)
