        - Antagonizing gangs/police or armed individuals for no character reason
        - Players should not be inserting themselves into ongoing situations or shootouts, between two groups or one group and the police.

    Criminal Activites:
        - Criminal activities are limited to (x) players max at a time.
            - Relaying information to or between characters (lookouts, radio communications) counts you as part of that scenario.
            - Choosing shooters/grinders over roleplayers is not acceptable.
            - Whenever characters are brought into police custody and a second group is formed to attempt a prison break or transport break, that second group is not allowed to intervene until the prison transport begins.
