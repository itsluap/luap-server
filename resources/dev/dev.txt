Necessities:
    - find someone else to help out and test stuff with - give mlo/money as reward
    - vehicle handing is basically fucked like always - will pay for something nopixel like

Testing:
    - test okokContract
    - apartments should be raidable now
    - see if panicbutton is played to everyone, should only be heard by police

Bugs:
    - players flicker invisible inside mlos - ask in gabz support chat about this
    - cant clear calls from dispatch in mdt

Notes:
    - the "press E to open" menu is - exports['qb-core']:DrawText(text, 'left') and to hide - exports['qb-core']:HideText()
    - ps-ui can be used instead of the above ^^^
    - server color ? 53B3CB
    - GlobalState.isLEO returns true if player has job from ps-mdt config.lua
    - /grantlicense (for weapon license and driver license) (police command)
    - can exchange cryptosticks at lesters
    - can use ifak to heal self

Final (Ready to Launch):
    - make sure all scripts are updated (qbcore and project sloth)
    - cars should be 100% (no light bugs) (no oversized textures) (no crazy handling)
    - clothing should be 100% (no glitched out clothing) (should be in qb-clothing)
    - mlos should be 100% (no bad collisions) (no player flickering) (locks on buildings needed)
    - items should be 100% (correct items in animations) (drug/alcohol effects) (health,thirst,stress)
    - all jobs need a final test (police, ems, civilian)
    - all criminal activities need a final test
    - create new user guide - create some faqs - get discord ready
    - create website - needs forums, applications, and tebex store
    - 

Other:
    -
    - steal players from other servers (give out a beta test reward) NEED A LOYAL TEAM - reach out to old fivem friends
    - go through and remove unneeded commands (search all server files)
