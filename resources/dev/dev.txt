    - ps-ui can be used instead of the above ^^^ -- did this
    - GlobalState.isLEO returns true if player has job from ps-mdt config.lua, returns false if any other job
    - drug effects are in qb-smallresources (consumables)
    - set light ids to unique id (cant be above 1013) (for headlights)

    - editor commands are: "record", "clip", "saveclip", "delclip", "editor"
