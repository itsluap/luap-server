Dev Notes:
    - server color ? 53B3CB blue \ 5500FF  indigo
    - the "press E to open" menu is - exports['qb-core']:DrawText(text, 'left') and to hide - exports['qb-core']:HideText()
    - ps-ui can be used instead of the above ^^^ -- did this
    - GlobalState.isLEO returns true if player has job from ps-mdt config.lua, returns false if any other job
    - drug effects are in qb-smallresources (consumables)
    - set light ids to unique id (cant be above 1013) (for headlights)
    - clothing has to be for mp male or female (no franklin)

For Vehicles From Hashiyara:
    - L3 cars are S+
    - L2 cars are S 
    - L1 cars are A+

Gangs:

Other:
    - steal players from other servers (give out a beta test reward) NEED A LOYAL TEAM - reach out to old fivem friends

    -

Ideas:
    - give lockpicks durability?
    - ps-ui, gang influence areas
    - OkOkContract for selling cars
    - add durability to ifak - not native, need to write this
    - add drug buffs / ps-buffs
