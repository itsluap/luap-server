Necessities:
    - Police: cuffing, dragging, seating, jailing, mdt, dispatch, armory, mlos, better cars
    - EMS   : calls from downed players, heal players, revive players, body bag, stretcher, airmed, better ambulance
    - test all criminal activities and all civilian jobs

Bugs:
    - players flicker invisible inside mlos
    - cant clear calls from dispatch in mdt
    - floating lights at pillbox - need to buy from gabz

Notes:
    - the "press E to open" menu is - exports['qb-core']:DrawText(text, 'left') and to hide - exports['qb-core']:HideText()
    - ps-ui can be used instead of the above ^^^
    - server color ? 53B3CB
    - GlobalState.isLEO returns true if player has job from ps-mdt config.lua
