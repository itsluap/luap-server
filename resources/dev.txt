Main Stuff:
    - server color ? 53B3CB

Necessities:
    - EMS   : calls from downed players, heal players, revive players, body bag, stretcher, airmed, better ambulance
    - vehicle shop (go through vehicles, check prices, only basic cars available at pdm)
    - apartment
    - better notifications
    - test all criminal activities and all civilian jobs

Bugs:
    - shadows in houses are broke, apartments are fine
    - cant clear calls from dispatch in mdt
    - apartment stash only shows up when standing on top of it - (coords run an algorithim in qb-apartments)(try vector4 without algorithim?)
    - cocaine plane stalls during take off?
    - floating lights at pillbox (learn how to edit maps)

To Do:
    - bypass qb-spawn for characters that arent new?
    - make lockpicking car doors medium difficulty
    - stripclub script from dream (or try to find online)
    - casino - working wheel spin?
    - finish rewriting boosting script
    -
    - elevator tp for hospital and city hall
    - fix broken doors at mrpd - add locks to doors that need it
    -
    -
    - job mlos
    - civ jobs
    -
    - add ps-buffs and possibly ps-progressbar and ps-drugsproccessing
    -
    - steal players from other servers (give out a beta test reward) NEED A LOYAL TEAM - reach out to old fivem friends
    -
    - create new user guide - create some faqs - get discord ready
    - create website - needs forums, applications, and tebex store

Ideas:
    - give lockpicks durability?
    - ps-ui, gang influence areas
    - gun crafting or blackmarket or both? (ask icey)
    - name ideas: blue rp, midnight,

Notes:
    - the "press E to open" menu is - exports['qb-core']:DrawText(text, 'left') and to hide - exports['qb-core']:HideText()
