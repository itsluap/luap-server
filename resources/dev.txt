Main Stuff:
    - server color ? 53B3CB

Necessities:
    - Police: cuffing, dragging, seating, jailing, mdt, dispatch, armory, mlos, better cars
    - EMS   : calls from downed players, heal players, revive players, body bag, stretcher, airmed, better ambulance
    - vehicle shop (go through vehicles, check prices, only basic cars available at pdm)
    - apartment
    - better notifications
    - test all criminal activities and all civilian jobs

Bugs:
    - shadows in houses are broke, apartments are fine
    - cant clear calls from dispatch in mdt
    - cocaine plane stalls during take off?
    - floating lights at pillbox (learn how to edit maps) lodlights_small030.ymap

To Do:
    - bypass qb-spawn for characters that arent new? - try to figure this out
    - make lockpicking car doors medium difficulty
    - stripclub script from dream (or try to find online)
    - casino - working wheel spin?
    - finish rewriting boosting script
    -
    - elevator tp  city hall?

    -
    - job mlos
    - civ jobs
    -
    - add ps-buffs and possibly ps-progressbar and ps-drugsproccessing
    -
    - steal players from other servers (give out a beta test reward) NEED A LOYAL TEAM - reach out to old fivem friends
    -
    - create new user guide - create some faqs - get discord ready
    - create website - needs forums, applications, and tebex store
    -
    - go through and remove unneeded commands (search all server files)

Ideas:
    - give lockpicks durability?
    - ps-ui, gang influence areas
    - gun crafting or blackmarket or both? (ask icey)
    - name ideas: blue rp, midnight, name the server indigo 100%

Notes:
    - the "press E to open" menu is - exports['qb-core']:DrawText(text, 'left') and to hide - exports['qb-core']:HideText()
