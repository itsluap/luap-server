-created "Scaled Topspeed" version of this mod, converting the unique handling of each of the 311 vehicles to new specs.
 Speed is scaled to vanilla GTAV levels while all features of this mod (realistic grip, realistic cornering, 
 realistic acceleration, realistic brakes, realistic suspension, downforce, PIT-maneuver...)
 are preserved. Even the acceleration and topspeed advantages of each car and bike remain intact.

-added proper downforce to each individual car. The increase in force/grip closely resembles 
 that of each car's corresponding real life counterpart.

-new tire grip settings reduce understeer while increasing the need for counter-steer during drifts
-car suspension saves more potential energy during compression, even small bumps will affect handling now
-cars are pushed upwards and suffer minor loss of stabilty when driving over curbs
-reworked the properties of all driveable surfaces (significant improvements to all sorts of on-road and off-road terrain. 
 Also includes adjustments to wet surfaces and shallow water)
-removed the 130kmh speed cap on dirt roads and runways (rally cars can go up to 220kmh now)
-increased drag and tire sink-in in swampy areas (cars can actually get stuck)
-improved collision with foliage (small bushes apply less force to car)
-small AI improvement: normal traffic and racing AI handle sharp turns better. Also applies to motorcycles.
-wheels can lock up. Removed ABS from a handful of cars.
-all car handlings created from scratch for version 2.0 feature more realistic collisions and rollovers

Changes:
-removed realistic propeller plane handlings from this mod (due to incompatibility with AI, missions
 and the lack of proper elevator trim)
-reduced vanilla airplane turbulences by an average of 70%
-increased weight transfer during cornering, braking, accelerating
-improved center of mass. Cars are more likely to roll over during collisions and hillclimb
-increased compatibility with story missions.
-fixed faulty tire physics that R* gave the latest DLC cars (meadows and sand offering MORE GRIP than tarmac) 
-changed engine and transmission settings of electric cars in order to achieve more realistic acceleration curve.
-made adjustments to how quickly transmissions can change gears.
-improved z-axis pivot point coordinates for cars and bikes.
-small increase in tire squeal when braking
-tweaked police cars to work better with AI limitations
-tweaked car handling in heavy rain

Other:
-Police3 (Police Cruiser) physics are still screwed up. Rockstar did this and there is nothing i can do about it. 
 Its hardcoded and ignores config files, only the idiots at Rockstar can fix this bug.
